Implentation of various graph algorithms
=======================================================

* Construction of Graph
It contains two methods of inititalizing a graph

==> Initialze a graph randomly using specified edge cost range and density

==> Initialize a graph using a file containing number of vertices followed by triplets (vertex1 vertex2 cost)


* Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm

* Implementation of Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm
